	<h2>The Tyger</h2>
	<p>	
	Tyger Tyger, burning bright, 
	In the forests of the night; 
	What immortal hand or eye, 
	Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
	</p>
	<p>
	In what distant deeps or skies. 
	Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
	On what wings dare he aspire?
	What the hand, dare seize the fire?
	</p>
	<p>
	And what shoulder, & what art,
	Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
	And when thy heart began to beat,
	What dread hand? & what dread feet?
	</p>
	<p>
	What the hammer? what the chain, 
	In what furnace was thy brain?
	What the anvil? what dread grasp, 
	Dare its deadly terrors clasp! 
	</p>
	<p>
	When the stars threw down their spears 
	And water'd heaven with their tears: 
	Did he smile his work to see?
	Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
	</p>
	<p>
	Tyger Tyger burning bright, 
	In the forests of the night: 
	What immortal hand or eye,
	Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
